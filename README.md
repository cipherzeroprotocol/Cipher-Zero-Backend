# Cipher Zero Protocol Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the Cipher Zero Protocol backend repository. This Node.js-based backend powers our decentralized, privacy-focused file sharing and messaging platform. It integrates advanced features like ZK-SNARKs, enhanced BitTorrent functionality, and cross-chain interoperability.

## Key Components

### CipherTorrent

Our custom BitTorrent client with privacy enhancements:

- `config`: Configuration settings
- `extension`: Metadata handling
- `torrent`: Core torrent functionality including data management, tracking, and utilities
- `wormhole`: Cross-chain bridge integration
- `zksnark`: Zero-knowledge proof generation and verification
- `zksync`: Layer 2 scaling solution
- `privacy_dht`: Privacy-enhanced Distributed Hash Table
- `zk_enhanced_torrent.js`: ZK-SNARK enhanced torrent operations

### API and Controllers

- `api`: RPC and smart contract APIs
- `controllers`: File, node, transaction, and ZK-Torrent controllers

### Services

- `interoperabilityService.js`: Cross-chain functionality
- `nodeService.js`: Node management
- `securityService.js`: Security features
- `transactionService.js`: Transaction handling
- `zkTorrentService.js`: ZK-enhanced torrent operations

### Routes

Extensive routing for various functionalities including file operations, node management, transactions, and ZK-Torrent operations.

### Privacy Tools

- `mPC_tools.js`: Multi-party computation tools
- `privacy_tools.js`: General privacy utilities
- `torrent_privacy_tools.js`: Torrent-specific privacy enhancements
- `zkSNARKs_tools.js`: Zero-knowledge proof utilities
